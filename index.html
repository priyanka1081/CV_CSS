            from the next line is google copied. So you can ignore that. In short, web developers build and maintain websites. 
            Web developers often work for clients who are trying to get their product or service onto the web. The work is typically 
            very project focused and involves collaborating with a team that helps to coordinate the client's needs into the end product.

              cook and tradesman who is proficient in all aspects of food ... cuisine of the 19th century. 
              The culinary arts, among other aspects of the French language introduced French loan-words into the English language.

            <h3>Painting</h3>
            <p> üåà My second skill is painting. I like painting. I have made sketches. I also like to paint sceneries.
              Now google cpoied and pasted introduction. An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, 
              practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse 
              refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. However, the term is also often used in the entertainment
               business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (although less often for actors). 
               "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English in this context, but this use has become rare.
